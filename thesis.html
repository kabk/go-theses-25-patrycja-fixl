              This thesis examines the tourist as a non-harming figure of creative exploration, navigating and
              interacting within the dimensions of social media environments. It challenges the dominant narrative of
              platforms as escapist paradises, reframing them as spaces for curiosity and engagement with the Unknown,
              while attempting to reduce algorithmic influence.

              The global erosion of national borders and world-shrinking processes are explored through the lens of
              travel, technology, and the extension of tourism beyond the upper class. Analyzing technological
              developments from the Industrial Revolution, with the invention of the Internet and ‘smart’ devices,
              provides a historical context for research. By investigating the tourist as an epitome of travel and the
              contemporary implications of tourist activity on the platform, this paper investigates the tourist’s
              capacity to reverse global homogenization.

              Whether the tourist can escape the social media bubble and algorithm-induced decision-making will be
              examined through the analysis of historical records and literature deriving from media theory, net
              criticism,
              and philosophy.

                      Social media platforms serve as prime examples of this model. When a user encounters a link within
                      the app, <i>Instagram</i> opens the linked webpage internally, rather than redirecting the user to
                      an

                      of continued engagement after viewing the linked content. Ultimately, the walled garden steers
                      user navigation towards certain content while limiting access to data outside its boundaries.

                      The British TV series—<i>Century of the Self</i> (2002)—demonstrates how (among others)
                      advertising
                      strategies have been enhanced by psychoanalysis to create a model consumer society (in the
                      American
                      context). Changing it from a society of need to a society of desire by connecting to people’s
                      unconscious feelings and training their mind to “desiring new things before the old get worn out”.
                      Programming masses was not only achieved my powers of persuasion but subliminal manipulation of
                      the mind.
                      <br><br>
                      Since the late 1950s <i>subliminal stimuli</i> have been delivered through all forms of
                      mass-media. They
                      are defined as sensory inputs below the threshold of conscious awareness, meaning they are not
                      perceived consciously by the individual. These stimuli can influence thoughts, feelings, or
                      behaviors without the person being aware of them. They are messages or signals presented so
                      quickly, faintly, or subtly that they are not consciously detected, yet they may still have an
                      effect on the individual’s subconscious mind. Examples include hidden messages in advertisements
                      (like flashing messages like “Hungry”, “Eat Popcorn”, “Drink Coca-Cola” during cinema screenings
                      which effectively increased popcorn sales by 57.7 percent and Coca Cola sales by 18.1 percent) ,
                      or brief visual or auditory cues that are flashed too quickly for someone to consciously notice.

                      <i>Booking.com</i> and <i>Airbnb</i> have been accused of committing war crimes by facilitating
                      the rental of
                      homes in illegal Israeli settlements built on confiscated Palestinian land in the West Bank. These
                      settlements, which have expanded significantly since October 7, 2023, are a focal point of
                      violence and oppression. Palestinians living nearby suffer attacks, detentions, torture, and
                      killings, while Israeli settlers further entrench their control over the occupied territories. The
                      settlements are not only a physical infringement on Palestinian land but are part of a broader
                      pattern of human rights violations.These travel companies showcase the beauty and amenities of
                      accommodations in the settlements. By presenting a sanitized and attractive image for tourists
                      they contribute to the spread of propaganda that obscures the human rights violations happening in
                      the region.
                      Tourism activities that bring foreign visitors to the settlements have directly contributed to
                      their expansion, facilitating the Israeli government's long-term control over the occupied
                      territory.
                      The involvement of companies like Booking.com and Airbnb in the promotion of these settlements is
                      seen as prioritizing financial profit over ethical considerations. Despite the potential for
                      international legal consequences, these companies continue to see the settlements as a lucrative
                      business opportunity.
                      On May 23, a collective of European and Palestinian NGOs made public a criminal complaint against
                      Booking.com in The Netherlands. They accused the company of money laundering in connection to war
                      crimes, as the enterprise profits from renting out accommodation in Israeli settlements in
                      occupied Palestinian territory.

                      The <i>Airbnb effect</i> refers to the negative impact that platforms like Airbnb have on housing
                      prices
                      and communities, particularly in popular cities. It is similar to gentrification, where rising
                      property values and rental prices push out local residents due to financial constraints. Studies
                      in cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Edinburgh, and Los Angeles have shown that Airbnb-driven
                      overtourism contributes to this phenomenon.
                      <br><br>
                      While Airbnb offers economic benefits such as increased tourism and additional income for
                      homeowners and landlords, concerns have emerged about its long-term effects on local housing
                      markets. The platform's impact includes reducing the availability of housing stock for long-term
                      rentals, as landlords convert properties into short-term let raising prices and eventually making
                      them unaffordable to native residents.

                      The visa process impacts people’s plans and time. While having travel tickets and hotel stays
                      already pre-booked is a condition to even qualify for the visa, there aren’t guarantees of it
                      being approved. Any suspicion of immigration attempts (other illegal activity) will immediately
                      qualify the application to be rejected. A single denial, once recorded in the system, will most
                      likely trigger a chain of further rejections.

                      Compared with today’s standardization, early passport photos didn’t appear to have many rules at
                      all. As access to photography was limited and having one’s picture taken was very expensive,
                      images might be cut out of group photos, show smiling people decked out in full religious garb or
                      a hat, or even be portraits of people doing the things that they loved. The notion of assigning a
                      passport to a single person was also a later one (1920).
                      <br><br>
                      Collective passports included family passports in which family pictures used to be accepted to
                      constitute for whole family travel documents and group passports for groups of workers or
                      refugees.
                      <br><br>
                      While single women were entitled to travel alone, married women until the 1930s were only
                      footnotes on their husband’s passports (e.g. Mr. John Smith and wife) meaning they couldn’t make
                      use of the document without their husband present.
                      Photography, despite its ability to record the uniqueness of individual bodies, proved to be a
                      technology that could control one's mobility.

                      popular discourse were often ill informed by Euro-colonial narratives in a tone that justified the

                      <i>European offline romanticism</i> is a term that can refer to a contemporary or nostalgic
                      movement that
                      seeks to recapture the ideals and aesthetic values of traditional European romanticism, but in an
                      offline, non-digital context. This may involve a return to more tangible, intimate, and personal
                      experiences, away from the overwhelming presence of technology and digital media.

                      According to Henri Lefebvre, the realm of perception and imagination are not separable from
                      physical and social space. With time, (the imagined) perceived space and its visually understood
                      materiality (<i>le perch</i>) change into the embodied form of a lived space, defined as
                      authenticity (</i>le

                  Romantization of travel inspired the European bourgeoisie of the 17th century to embark on journeys of
                  self-cultivation around the continent during their youth, to deepen their self-awareness as inheritors
                  of European culture. While traveling to this day remains nested in privilege, instinctual curiosity
                  propelled humanity to progress. Technological advancements of the first (1760–1830) and second
                  Industrial Revolution (late 19th–20th century) for the first time made travel accessible to members of
                  the working-class.

                  <i>Tourism</i> was the manifestation of the apex of the desire to explore the world.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">The United Nations defines tourism as a social, cultural, and economic phenomenon that
                  entails the movement of people to places outside their usual environment for personal or professional
                  reasons, staying away from their homes for more than one night but less than one year. Existing
                  tourism
                  typologies provide a diverse range of options for all types of ­travelers—from mass to niche, domestic
                  to international, inbound to outbound, and beyond.

                <p class="indent">No-visa agreements, improved infrastructure, digitalization of booking services, and
                  low-cost transportation facilitated travel and globalized tourism. Since goods, services and
                  socio-cultural influences started homogenizing, arbitrary borders between countries began to dissolve
                  into a <i>Global Village</i>. Marshall McLuhan developed this term in the 1960s to deal with a trend
                  in
                  which the advancements in (communication) technologies shrunk the world into a closely knit community.
                  The advent of the internet has been heralded as its quintessential medium, having ushered in an era of
                  unprecedented connectivity and interactivity happening in real-time, regardless of geographical
                  location.

                <p class="indent">
                  In 2020, the smooth, borderless plane of the <i>Global Village</i> collapsed. The COVID-19
                  pandemic caused countries to close their borders, making travel and exploration unattainable again.
                  Forced to replace real-life exploration, we turned to the Explore page, where the "cyber-" prefix took
                  over, and the tourist turned Internet Explorer. The web, which began as a static, informational space
                  (<i>Web 1.0</i>), evolved into a social, user-driven platform (<i>Web 2.0</i>), and eventually
                  incorporated
                  intelligent, decentralized dynamics (<i>Web 3.0</i>), reflecting an increasing desire for connection
                  and
                  interaction. By 2020, these digital environments had become direct manifestations of the cybernetic
                  dynamics of control, access, and communication.

                  The root of the word cybernetics is the Latin
                  <i>­kybernetes</i> (steerman, guide) and <i>kybernan</i> (to steer or pilot a ship), linking its
                  etymology to
                  voyagery. When the global community retreated into digital spaces, the internet's evolution mirrored
                  the
                  shift toward virtual exploration in place of physical travel.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">The platform environment, however, shaped by algorithmic highways, forms a landscape
                  where the state of true exploration based on chance and openness is hindered. So while the tourist,
                  who
                  visits different countries guided by individual interest and the desire to explore <i>the Unknown</i>,
                  is an
                  important agent in reversing the world-shrinking trend, the platform trapped them in a custom bubble
                  tailored to them. An environment that controls the user's access to network-based content and services
                  is defined as a <i>walled garden</i>.

                  However, since territorial constraints have never stopped humankind from exploring
                  what’s beyond the horizon, the entrapment of virtual space should not obstruct online discoveries.

                  intensification of anti-­tourist movements responding to post-pandemic tourist influx. There is a hint
                  of colonialism in the way well-­subsidized travel undertakings take over infrastructure around cities,
                  generating costs that most local inhabitants could never afford. The apparently

                  seen
                  in the realm of ‘secondary reality’. Martin Pawley in Terminal Architecture discusses how owners of
                  electronic spaces lease or sell these ‘realities’ to consumers via distributors and retailers. He
                  predicted that the emergence of these enterprises reflects how the sale and leasing of reality is

                  with visa-free access to over 190 countries. Despite growing up in a working-class family and never
                  traveling outside Europe due to cost, my passport has provided ease of movement opening doors as
                  effortlessly as I do. Meanwhile, my social media presence since age 13 has further connected me to
                  global communities and events.

                  the hallucination. Whatever you may call it, the impulse manifests as an explosion of personal desires

                  This brings me to how this <i>Avatour</i> came to life. I grew up with access to technology and
                  continue
                  to be
                  surrounded by it in my professional and private life. With my first PC being one with the Windows XP
                  operating system and its iconic default green meadow wallpaper, I have always associated the smooth
                  surface of the screen with idyllic landscapes. The transition from Windows to OS X, one Californian
                  landscape was replaced by many others. Each time I would look away from the screen for a moment long
                  enough for it to auto-lock, I returned to the same beautiful photograph. The impulse got nurtured
                  further when I transitioned to social media where across platforms algorithms and advertisements were
                  inviting me to Brazil and Bali summers, globe-trotter content, and celebrity getaway weekends.

                  Ultra-smooth experiences have come to signify the platform era, which erased human traces from its
                  interaction-based environment. Quoting Alex Quicho, the predominant goal of the platform era has been
                  to render consumption frictionless and switching between different environments (apps) uninterrupted.

                  Strategically pressured into making a quick choice and sealing it with submitting payment details, the
                  remaining preparations include reserving travel tickets, applying for visas—an inherently racialized
                  and discriminatory process

                  validity. The
                  same kind of preparation is required for platform users. Penetrating the screen involves a state
                  change from the physical, biological space of the corporeal viewer to the symbolic, metaphorical
                  consensual hallucination of cyberspace. The transition from offline to online is made possible through
                  <i>avatars</i>. In computing, an avatar is a graphical representation of a user, the user's character,
                  or
                  persona. They can take on the form of 2d icons, or 3d models. It derives from the Sanskrit word
                  avatāra. In Hinduism, it stands for the descent of a deity into a terrestrial form.
                  <sup id="fnref-28">
                    <a href="#fn-28">28</a>
                  </sup>
                  In platform culture, it is the terrestrial form that turns meta. The transformation from physical to
                  digital happens through platform-baptism during which we gain a new (user)name and confirm our
                  existence online. Depending on the platform it can be as simple as selecting from the ready-made
                  avatar models waiting for our life-giving finger tap to become our platform stand-ins, choosing a
                  picture from our camera roll, or by a personalized customization where we get to make our avatar as
                  similar or different from our actual appearance as we’d like.

                <p class="indent">
                  No avatar or username equals no account equals no access. The same logic applies to owning a valid
                  passport—no valid document equals no travel. Therefore, the essence and cruciality of the prep phase
                  lies in granting access. The passport/account verifies your identity permitting you to enter different
                  spaces. It is a key to the world embossed with a name and photo.

                  This key however doesn’t come without an implication of privilege and control. Passports in the form
                  we know today serve as the main identity certificate when crossing borders. On as little as 125mm by
                  88 mm, they hold information from full name and citizenship to biometric identifiers such as
                  fingerprints, face, and iris structure. The current standard for passport pictures is a
                  black-and-white mugshot, with face and eyes fully visible and mouth closed in a ­“neutral”
                  (non-smiling) manner. Neutrality generates better matches for face-scanning softwares. Stiff
                  guidelines, time pressure, and the judging camera lens leave many people dissatisfied, to say the
                  least.

                  Stepping out of one's day-to-day environment is the condition for becoming a tourist. As exciting as
                  leaving your home grounds is, it includes hardships such as unforeseen delays, traffic, lengthy

                  <i>Romanticism</i>—known for its predilection for the foreign, remote, and mysterious—glamorized
                  traveling and
                  resulted in a reinterpretation of the anxieties that accompany it. One of the movement's most defining
                  works—<i>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog</i> by Caspar David Friedrich—represents the first prototype of
                  a
                  tourist. While having certain expectations of what the journey will bring, the thick layer of fog
                  prevents the wanderer from knowing what he’s about to pass through. His wander is a confrontation with
                  <i>the Unknown</i>, which could be seen as either a sign of stupidity or intelligence. What if
                  embarking
                  on a
                  journey despite not knowing puts his life at risk? But, by refusing to take that leap, he would
                  deprive
                  himself of the pleasure of experiencing something new. Romantic <i>wanderlust</i>

                  cultivated the desire to conquer fear in pursuit of self-improvement. Just like a flame that draws the
                  moth in, the fog strengthens the wanderer’s desire to travel rephrasing the fear of the Unknown into
                  the
                  thrill of the Unknown.

                  Early European records from non-European contact, while promising reliable and factual eye-witness
                  stories, sought to impose European ideology on their expanding physical world. Those fictional

                  in

                  The unique, first-person storytelling, enabled by a camera, has made many people’s lives feel like
                  ­movie scenes. This shift in perspective ties directly into <i>Main Character Energy</i>, a recent
                  internet-born term that reflects the idea of seeing your life as a narrative where you’re the
                  protagonist. It encourages taking charge of your story and embracing a sense of adventure in how you
                  spend your free time. Many travelers adopt the main character feeling, gazing out the window as they
                  daydream about upcoming adventures. The window is a bridge between the familiar and the unknown and a
                  portal to becoming a tourist.

                  In computing, a window is a visual and interactive space that allows users to manage and interact with

                  constantly fueled by the platform’s Explore page. Platforms serve as aspirational spaces, drawing
                  users
                  in with the promise of discovering something new. Sharing private data and coordinates seems a small
                  price to pay in return for access to new knowledge, connections, and experiences. In contrast to
                  IRL-travel, which involves the dea of a body in motion, traveling through the platform’s architecture
                  puts the body in a state of immobility. A voluntary hyperimmobility that goes against notions of
                  progress and freedom and tortured us during the pandemic lockdown. Realizing that screen windows were

                  Upon arrival, we also realize that we step into an environment where most probably no one knows us.
                  The destination acts as a reset button for our identity allowing us to consider how we would like to
                  be perceived during our holiday. There is an interesting relationship between the secrecy we adopt to
                  allow ourselves to form new connections and impressions (detached from what we’ve been molded into our
                  whole life). The secrecy of being unknown on location, allows tourists to move into a state of
                  openness.

                  Hiroki Azuma in <i>Philosophy of the Tourist</i> (2023) frames the tourist figure as a link between
                  private
                  lived sensations and public foreign affairs, all while remaining private. That means that the tourist
                  exists outside of politics as an anonymous agent. Like a newborn that comes into the world, the
                  tourist needs to learn everything about the new surroundings. Infatuated by the metaphorical rebirth,
                  tourists enter exploration mode, during which the Unknown loses its prefix and becomes familiar.
                  Exploration is the chance for enlightenment and the biggest attraction of tourism. We are likely to
                  encounter things we wouldn't back in our home countries. Azuma gives the example of people going to an
                  art gallery on holiday even though they don’t even like art. Or how in the 1900s guidebooks of the
                  Paris Exposition recommended visiting sewers, morgues, and slaughterhouses as attractions.

                  Trevor Noah's 2018 sketch, <i>Son of Patricia</i>, humorously highlighted how visiting the homes of
                  locals
                  (what he called poverty porn) was marketed to tourists as “an authentic Bali experience.” The tourist
                  as a distinct consumer category cannot be delinked from the drive for capitalistic gains. It is not
                  the link to capital itself that renders the tourist problematic, but rather the overdetermination by
                  things like <i>TX</i> (tourist experience, much like UX and catering to the consumer category of
                  platform users). The fabrication of authenticity in experiencing locations, and propagating polished
                  and
                  sanitized versions of the destination, not only generates unified impressions of places but contests
                  the realism of the experience on-site altogether. The touristic illusion is glued onto the site's
                  actual topography, and what remains is an exploration of synthetic nature.

                  enters into a state of ultimate passivity. As Pawley writes: “Today we live in a part natural, part
                  man-made environment that is swamped by fast-evolving intentions.” The latter includes the technology
                  layer or tele-reality shaped by electronic awareness. This tele-reality does not blind us but changes

                  The development of tourism and photography went hand-in-hand with 19th-century France as its cradle.
                  Developments in the field of photography and the growing popularity of its digital form established
                  the dependence of the tourists' existence on the camera. First, photographs/videos of the host
                  community formed the impulse to travel. On location, it allowed us to capture moments precious to the
                  exploration. The photo became proof of the tourist activity, and tourist’s existence as a whole.
                  Recording anything that seems different from home resulted in a compulsive photo-taking habit and the
                  freezing of bodies in selfie-pose. It also made evident that the photograph became more important than
                  the lived experience. Susan Sontag wrote how consumption is fundamental to the medium of photography.
                  In the introduction of photographer Peter Hujar’s book, <i>Portraits in Life and Death</i> (1976), she
                  wrote
                  that: “Photography converts the world itself into a department store or museum-without-walls in which
                  every subject is depreciated into an article of consumption, promoted into an item for aesthetic
                  appreciation.” Instagram led us to become 24/7 flâneurs stuck in this department store at all hours of
                  the day. The platform became defined by online performativity and aggravated the society of the
                  spectacle, in which capitalism has led people to become more obsessed with aesthetic value rather than
                  experiences.

                  Photographs became a requirement for users to communicate. While in the early stages of the platform,
                  photographs seemed genuine, tools like Photoshop, FaceTune, (face)filters, and other photo-altering
                  tools reframed it as a performed illusion.

                  <i>Jennifer in Paradise</i> was the first digital image
                  demonstrating that software could be the promise of a more perfect world. Jennifer, who like a real
                  tourist main character gazes into the turquoise waters of Bora Bora, is the last person to inhabit a
                  world where the camera never lied.

                  paintings, while contemplating the impact of technology on society and memory, he steganographically
                  concealed a message to Jennifer Knoll (the woman in the picture) in which he acknowledges how this
                  image played a significant role in shaping digital culture and wonders about Jennifer's thoughts on

                  The platform further blurred the distinction between real and fake, and AI carries on its legacy.
                  Regardless of <i>blue-check validations</i>, the lack of authenticity radiates through each pixel of
                  the
                  screen. The backend of digital platforms relies on the classification and discrimination of data
                  tracking our activity. Online, the time we spend marveling at a piece of content gets tracked and
                  informs the content that will be fed to us in the future. The architecture of the platform makes true
                  exploration impossible. The <i>Explore Page</i> is a lie. While users appreciate the way the platform
                  knows
                  them and helps them to make decisions, when scrolling in the way the platform intended there is
                  nothing authentic about their presence online. The spectacle was exacerbated with the introduction of
                  the algorithmic feed.

                <p class="indent">
                  In March 2016, Instagram started transforming its feed from chronological order to algorithmic meaning
                  that rather than seeing posts how they were posted we now see posts would be displayed first based on
                  like- and comment-based performance. Kyle Chayka explains algorithm impact in his book,
                  <i>Filterworld:
                    How Algorithms Flattened Culture</i> (2024): “The byword was <i>engagement</i>: whatever was popular
                  would be
                  pushed to become more popular; whatever didn’t get immediate attention was deemed undeserving and
                  allowed to slip quickly into the void. Algorithms sought to “<i>personalize</i>” feeds, but the effect
                  was
                  that social media began to feel less personal.”

                  to

                  An updated <i>tourist mode</i> might be a solution to it. Aware of the seasonal tourist floodings,

                  increasingly try to plan their holidays around them. Tired of the artificial experience offered by
                  tour guides and travel agencies during organized trips, self-organized trips start to take over.
                  Resisting TripAdvisor recommendations and letting the destination guide you. What if you consciously
                  include randomness into your exploration, get on a random bus, leave at a random stop, walk for a few
                  hours. Then repeat.
